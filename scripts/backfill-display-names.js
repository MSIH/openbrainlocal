/**
 * Reduce existing person contacts' display name to first+last (#156). The importer now defaults a
 * new contact's canonical_name to given+family (dropping a middle name), keeping the full name as a
 * resolvable alias — but contacts imported before that still read "Amy Margaret Schneider" in the
 * UI and search. Re-importing can't fix them (the re-import path never touches canonical_name, and
 * import:contacts skips a matched UID), so this standalone backfill does it — mirrors
 * backfill-phone-aliases.js / backfill-relations.js.
 *
 * For each live person entity whose canonical_name is a clean 3-token first-middle-last, it sets
 * canonical to first+last and keeps BOTH the full name and the reduced form as name aliases (so
 * resolution by either still works). Idempotent: a 2-token name is skipped, so a re-run reduces 0.
 * A UI-shortened name is already 2-token and left alone. Back up life-context.db first.
 *   Run:  npm run backfill:display-names
