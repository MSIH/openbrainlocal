/**
 * Backfill the phone-alias canonicalization (#129) onto contacts imported before this change.
 * `normalizePhone` now strips a leading US/Canada `1` from an 11-digit key, so `+12564680130`
 * and `(256) 468-0130` share the key `2564680130`. Existing entities were aliased under the old
 * digit-strip-only key (e.g. `12564680130`), so a lookup in the other format never resolved.
 * This re-aliases every `alias_type='phone'` row under its canonical key.
 *
 * Append-only + idempotent + tombstone-respecting: new keys go in via insertAliasUnlessTombstoned
 * (skips a #111-removed alias, INSERT OR IGNORE on the UNIQUE key), the old key is left untouched
 * (harmless once lookups canonicalize). A second run adds 0. Re-importing the source vCards can't
 * do this (import:contacts skips a matched UID before reading content), which is why this is a
 * standalone backfill — mirrors npm run backfill:relations (#93).
 *   Run:  npm run backfill:phones
