# devsession-claude

> Renamed from `devsession`. If you registered a `.claude/settings.json` hook pointing at the old `devsession/index.js` path, update it to `devsession-claude/index.js` (see Setup below). The ingest payload's `source` field also changed from `'devsession'` to `'devsession-claude'` — artifacts already ingested under the old value keep it; only new ingests use the new one, so a `search`/`GET /api/v1/ingest` query scoped to `source: 'devsession'` won't find sessions recorded after this change (and vice versa) unless you backfill. The name change reflects that this connector is specifically for Claude Code — see [the sibling-connectors issue](https://github.com/MSIH/life-context-connectors/issues/10) (transferred to the core tracker) for planned sibling connectors covering other AI coding tools.

A Claude Code `SessionEnd` (and, optionally, `PreCompact`) hook that turns every coding session into a searchable `dev_session` artifact in [LifeContext](https://github.com/msih/life-context). Implements [Milestone 1](https://github.com/msih/life-context/issues/28) of the LifeContext roadmap — the **push** reference connector.

## What it does

1. Claude Code invokes `index.js` on `SessionEnd` (and, if registered, `PreCompact`), passing hook JSON (`session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`, …) on stdin.
2. It reads the session transcript and asks a chat model for a short summary — what was done, key decisions and why, next steps. By default (`CHAT_PROVIDER=claude-cli`) this shells out to the `claude` binary already authenticated in the environment — no local LLM or separate API key required, and it works the same whether Claude Code is running on your laptop or in a Claude Code web/cloud container. `CHAT_PROVIDER=openai` switches to the original path: any local or hosted OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint (Ollama by default).
3. It `POST`s the summary to LifeContext as `POST /api/v1/ingest`, `type: 'dev_session'`, `source: 'devsession-claude'`, `source_id` = the Claude Code session UUID.
4. If LifeContext is unreachable, the payload is appended to a local spool file instead of being dropped; the next session's hook run flushes anything spooled before processing itself.

## Setup

1. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in:
   - `LIFECONTEXT_URL` / `LIFECONTEXT_API_KEY` — where LifeContext is running and its `x-api-key` (set the key to the same value as `LIFECONTEXT_API_KEY` in the core server's own `.env`)
   - The default summarizer provider (`claude-cli`) needs nothing else configured. If you'd rather use a local/hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint, set `CHAT_PROVIDER=openai` and fill in `CHAT_BASE_URL` / `CHAT_MODEL` (and `CHAT_API_KEY` if the endpoint requires bearer auth) — see `.env.example`. (`life-context`'s [`docs/local-llm-setup-guide.md`](https://github.com/msih/life-context/blob/2.0/docs/local-llm-setup-guide.md) covers running Ollama locally.)
2. No `npm install` needed — zero dependencies, Node 18+ built-ins only (`fetch`, `fs/promises`, `child_process`).
3. Register the hook in your project's or user's `.claude/settings.json`. `SessionEnd` alone is enough to get started; also registering `PreCompact` (recommended — see below) captures long-running sessions before they compact instead of only at the very end:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node /absolute/path/to/life-context/connectors/devsession-claude/index.js",
            "timeout": 120
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node /absolute/path/to/life-context/connectors/devsession-claude/index.js",
            "timeout": 120
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

No `matcher` on either — `SessionEnd` fires for every reason (`clear`, `logout`, `prompt_input_exit`, …) and `PreCompact` fires for both `manual` (`/compact`) and `auto` (context-limit) triggers. Give both a generous `timeout`; the summarizer call can take a while (the `claude-cli` provider caps itself at `SUMMARIZE_TIMEOUT_MS`, ~90s, so a 120s hook timeout leaves headroom) and there's nothing to gain by cutting it off early (see Known Limitations below).

4. End a real coding session — the hook pushes it to LifeContext as a `dev_session` artifact. See "Recalling these sessions in Claude Code" below to actually get it back.

### Recalling these sessions in Claude Code

This hook only **pushes** sessions into LifeContext (`POST /api/v1/ingest`) — it is not itself the memory/recall path, and installing it doesn't make Claude Code recall anything. Recall is a separate MCP integration you register once, on the Claude Code side:

```bash
claude mcp add -s user --transport http lifecontext "$LIFECONTEXT_URL/mcp" --header "x-api-key: $LIFECONTEXT_API_KEY"
```

Once registered, the next morning try asking Claude Code "where did I leave off" — it should call the `search` tool and return the session artifact with the right project context. That's the roadmap's exit test for this connector. See [Claude Code's MCP docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp) for the `claude mcp add` command itself, and the [LifeContext README](https://github.com/msih/life-context/blob/2.0/README.md#interfaces) for the authoritative MCP/REST endpoint details.

### Why also register `PreCompact`

A session that runs for hours or days may not hit `SessionEnd` for a long time — or the hook process may get killed before it finishes when the session does end (see Known Limitations). `PreCompact` fires earlier, whenever the conversation is about to be compacted (manually via `/compact` or automatically at the context limit), while the full pre-compaction transcript is still on disk at `transcript_path`. Registering the same script under both events is safe to do unconditionally: ingest is upsert-by-`(source, source_id)` and `source_id` is the session UUID (unchanged across compactions), so a `PreCompact` send and a later `SessionEnd` send for the same session refine the same `dev_session` artifact rather than creating duplicates. The payload's `extra.hook_event` records which event produced each ingest (`'PreCompact'` or `'SessionEnd'`) if you need to tell them apart.

### Recursion guard (`claude-cli` provider)

The default provider spawns `claude -p` to do the summarizing — and that spawned process is itself a Claude Code session, which would normally also fire `SessionEnd`. Two layers prevent it from recursively summarizing itself:

1. `--safe-mode` on the spawned process disables all customizations there, including hooks — so it can't invoke this script at all.
2. Belt-and-suspenders: the spawned process's env also carries `DEVSESSION_DISABLE=1`, and `main()` checks that first, before anything else. If a future change ever drops `--safe-mode`, this second guard still stops the recursion.

`--no-session-persistence` additionally keeps the summarizer's own transient session off disk and out of `/resume`.

### Running on Claude Code web / cloud sessions

The `claude-cli` provider works unchanged in a Claude Code web/cloud container — the spawned `claude` binary inherits whatever credentials the outer session already has.

> **For a click-by-click walkthrough** of the Claude Code web environment settings below (with fake examples of exactly what to enter and where), see [`docs/08-claude-code-web-setup.md`](../../docs/08-claude-code-web-setup.md). The summary here is the reference; that doc is the tutorial.

**This repo already ships the wiring for its own cloud sessions.** `.claude/settings.json` registers this connector under both `SessionEnd` and `PreCompact`, guarded so it runs *only* in cloud containers:

```json
{ "type": "command", "shell": "bash", "timeout": 120,
  "command": "[ \"${CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE:-}\" = \"true\" ] && node \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/connectors/devsession-claude/index.js\" || true" }
```

The `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true` guard is the point: capturing *local* sessions stays the job of a user-level `~/.claude/settings.json` registration (which covers all your repos, not just this one), so the committed hook stands down locally — the guard short-circuits to `|| true` and node is never spawned. Without it, project + user hooks would both fire on every local session and summarize it twice (the upsert dedupes the artifact, but the summarizer would run twice). For contributors who don't run LifeContext, the committed hook is doubly inert: skipped locally by the guard, and a no-op in their own cloud sessions because the connector exits early when `LIFECONTEXT_API_KEY` is unset. **You do not register anything manually for this repo's cloud sessions** — you only set the environment variables below. (Other repos still need their own wiring plus the connector script on disk.)

What differs from a local setup:

- **No `.env` file reaches the container.** Cloud sessions only get the git checkout — configure `LIFECONTEXT_URL` / `LIFECONTEXT_API_KEY` (and `CHAT_PROVIDER`/`CHAT_MODEL` if overriding the default) as real environment variables in the [environment's own settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web); the existing `.env` loader already prefers real env vars over the file, so no code change is needed. Note the docs' warning: env vars are visible to anyone who can edit the environment config — treat `LIFECONTEXT_API_KEY` as a rotatable secret.
- **`LIFECONTEXT_URL` must be reachable from the container**, not `localhost` — point it at wherever LifeContext is actually exposed (the Cloudflare Tunnel from [`docs/07-cloudflare-tunnel-setup.md`](../../docs/07-cloudflare-tunnel-setup.md), or another public host).
- **The environment's network policy must allow that host.** The default "Trusted" allowlist won't include your personal tunnel domain — use a Custom allowlist (defaults + your domain) or Full access, or the ingest POST is blocked (and the payload only spools, which won't survive the container anyway).
- **The spool is best-effort only.** If ingest fails, the payload is written to `DEVSESSION_SPOOL_PATH` for retry on the next run — but a cloud container is ephemeral, so a spooled payload does not survive container reclaim. Acceptable for a best-effort hook; there's no durable fix without a persistent volume.

## Known limitations

- **`SessionEnd` cannot block session exit**, and Claude Code does not guarantee it waits for the hook process to finish. A slow summarizer call may be killed mid-summary before it can either produce a summary or fall back — in that case the session is silently not recorded. There's no full fix within a single-process hook; a future iteration could split "capture" (fast, synchronous) from "summarize + send" (a detached background process) if this proves to be a real problem in practice.
- **The transcript JSONL format is internal to Claude Code and undocumented** (it can change between releases). `readTranscriptTurns()` in `index.js` is deliberately defensive — every field access is optional-chained and any line that doesn't match the expected shape is skipped rather than throwing — but a future Claude Code release could still change the shape enough that summaries degrade or come back empty. Sessions below `MIN_USER_TURNS` (currently 1) are skipped rather than logged as an empty artifact.
- Near-empty sessions (no user turns) are skipped entirely — nothing worth remembering, and it avoids polluting search with empty artifacts.
- **Possible future provider: Codex CLI** (`codex exec`) as an alternative to `claude-cli` for users primarily on OpenAI's tooling — not implemented, tracked as a follow-up idea only.

## Verifying changes to this connector

`npm test` (`node --test test.mjs`) runs the automated suite — no `npm install`, no real API usage, matching the pattern `imessage/test.mjs` and `photo-exif/test.mjs` use. It spawns `index.js` as a real child process against a mock `node:http` ingest server (and, for the `openai` provider, a mock chat-completions server) and a stub `claude` script written to a temp dir and prepended onto `PATH`, so `execFile('claude', ...)` resolves to the stub instead of a real CLI. Covers: the `claude-cli` provider's happy path, the `DEVSESSION_DISABLE` recursion guard, the fallback-summary path when the summarizer fails, the `openai` provider's request shape with and without `CHAT_API_KEY`, and the `PreCompact`/`SessionEnd` dedup path from #4 (same `source_id`, distinct `extra.hook_event`) — note that a mock server which just logs bodies doesn't exercise LifeContext's real upsert dedup; the test only confirms both events produce a request keyed on the same `source_id`, which is what makes the upsert in a real server a refine-not-duplicate.

For a change the suite doesn't cover, the same ingredients work standalone: a `node:http` server logging `POST /api/v1/ingest` bodies, a hand-written executable `claude` script on `PATH`, and a fake hook payload on stdin — `{"session_id":"...","transcript_path":"<path-to-a-fixture-transcript.jsonl>","cwd":"..."}` (add `hook_event_name`/`trigger`/`custom_instructions` for a `PreCompact`-shaped payload) — pointing `transcript_path` at a small fixture JSONL matching the shape in `readTranscriptTurns()` (`{"message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"..."}]}}` per line). One real run with the actual `claude` binary is still worth doing after a summarizer-path change: `echo '<transcript>' | claude -p --safe-mode --no-session-persistence --tools "" --model haiku --system-prompt "<prompt>"` should print a plain-text summary.
